# Linear data structure
## Linked list 
It's a type of linear data structue ,<br>
in which data is stored in non-continious memory,<br>
it's elements are linked together using the pointers,<br>
## Advantages of linked list 
* it's a dynamic data structure
* it does not a definate size ,i.e. size can be increased or decreased
* Memory is well utilized in the linked list. Because in it, we do not have to allocate memory in advance.
* Its access time is very fast, and it can be accessed at a certain time without memory overhead.
* You can easily implement linear data structures using the linked list like a stack, queue.
